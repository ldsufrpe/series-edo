</h5>This is a little beyond the scope of the course. Roughly speaking, think about what would happen if the limit of the ratios did exist. If the limit were smaller than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> then it would tell you that the terms of our series must be getting smaller and smaller and smaller — which is impossible because they are all integers between 1 and 10. Similarly if the limit existed and were bigger than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> then the terms of the series would have to get bigger and bigger and bigger — also impossible. Hence if the ratio exists then it must be equal to 1 — but in that case because the terms are integers, they would have to be all equal when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>  became big enough. But that means that the expansion of <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span>  would be eventually periodic — something that only rational numbers do (a proof is given in the optional § <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "sec_RatIrr" missing or not unique]</code> at the end of this chapter).</div>
