<p>Find a power series representation for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p><em class="alert">Solution:</em> The secret to finding power series representations for a good many functions is to manipulate them into a form in which <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-y}\)</span> appears and use the geometric series representation  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-y} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty y^n\text{.}\)</span> We have deliberately renamed the variable to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> here — it does not have to be <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> We can use that strategy to find a power series expansion for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\)</span> — we just have to recognize that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\)</span> is the same as  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-y}\)</span> if we set <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x^2\text{.}\)</span></p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-x^2} &amp;= \frac{1}{1-y}\bigg|_{y=x^2}
=\bigg[\sum_{n=0}^\infty y^n

\quad\text{if $|y| \lt 1$, i.e. $|x| \lt 1$}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\big(x^2\big)}^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{2n}\\
&amp;= 1+x^2+x^4+x^6 +\cdots\hskip-0.2in

<p class="continuation">This is a perfectly good power series. There is nothing wrong with the power of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> being <span class="process-math">\(2n\text{.}\)</span> (This just means that the coefficients of all odd powers of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> are zero.) In fact, you should try to always write power series in forms that are as easy to understand as possible. The geometric series that we used at the end of the first line converges for</p>

\begin{gather*}
|y| \lt 1 \iff \big|x^2\big| \lt 1 \iff |x| \lt 1

</div>
<p class="continuation">So our power series has radius of convergence <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and interval of convergence <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 1\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#eg_SRpsrepAA" class="internal">em contexto</a></span>
