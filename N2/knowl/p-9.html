<p>In the above examples we have tried to understand the series by examining  the sum of the first few terms and then extrapolating as  we add in more and more terms. That is, we tried to sneak up on the  infinite sum by looking at the limit of (partial) sums of the first few terms. This approach can be made into a more formal rigorous definition.  More precisely, to define what is meant by the infinite sum  <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\text{,}\)</span> we approximate it by the sum of its first  <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> terms and then take the limit as <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> tends to infinity.</p>
