</h3>The field of asymptotic analysis often makes use of the first few terms of divergent series to generate approximate solutions to problems; this, along with numerical computations, is one of the most important techniques in applied mathematics. Indeed, there is a whole wonderful book  (which, unfortunately, is too advanced for most Calculus 2 students) devoted to playing with divergent series called, unsurprisingly, “Divergent Series” by G.H. Hardy. This is not to be confused with the “Divergent” series by V. Roth set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian Chicago. That latter series diverges quite dramatically from mathematical topics, while the former does not have a film adaptation (yet).</div>
