<p>There is another test that is very similar in spirit to the ratio test. It also comes from a reexamination of the geometric series</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a r^n
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The ratio test was based on the observation that <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> which largely determines whether or not the series converges, could be found by computing the ratio <span class="process-math">\(r = a_{n+1}/a_n\text{.}\)</span> The root test is based on the observation that <span class="process-math">\(|r|\)</span> can also be determined by looking that the <span class="process-math">\(n^{\rm th}\)</span> root of the <span class="process-math">\(n^{\rm th}\)</span> term with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> very large:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\root{n}\of{\big|ar^n\big|}
=|r|\lim_{n\to\infty}\root{n}\of{\big|a\big|}
=|r|\qquad\text{if $a\ne 0$}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Of course, in general, the <span class="process-math">\(n^{\rm th}\)</span> term is not exactly <span class="process-math">\(ar^n\text{.}\)</span> However, if for very large <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(n^{\rm th}\)</span> term is approximately proportional to <span class="process-math">\(r^n\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|r|\)</span> given by the above limit, we would expect the series to converge when <span class="process-math">\(|r| \lt 1\)</span> and diverge when <span class="process-math">\(|r| \gt 1\text{.}\)</span> That is indeed the case.</p>
