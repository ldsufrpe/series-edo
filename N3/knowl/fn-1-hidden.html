<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">The authors should be a little more careful making such a blanket statement. While it is true that it is not wise to approximate a divergent series by taking <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> terms with <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> large, there are cases when one can get a very good approximation by taking <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> terms with <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> small! For example, the Taylor remainder theorem shows us that when the <span class="process-math">\(n^{\rm th}\)</span> derivative of a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> grows very quickly with <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> Taylor polynomials of degree <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> large, can give bad approximations of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> while the Taylor polynomials of degree one or two can still provide very good approximations of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is very small. As an example of this, one of the triumphs of quantum electrodynamics, namely the computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, depends on precisely this. A number of important quantities were predicted using the first few terms of divergent power series. When those quantities were measured experimentally, the predictions turned out to be incredibly accurate.</div></body>
