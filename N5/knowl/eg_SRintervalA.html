</h4>
<p>We are told that a certain power series with centre <span class="process-math">\(c=3\text{,}\)</span> converges at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> and diverges at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> What else can we say about the convergence or divergence of the series for other values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>We are told that the series is centred at <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> so its terms are all powers of <span class="process-math">\((x-3)\)</span> and it is of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
\sum_{n \geq 0} A_n (x-3)^n.
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">A good way to summarise the convergence data we are given is with a figure like the one below. Green dots mark the values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where the series is known to converge. (Recall that every power series converges at its centre.) The red dot marks the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where the series is known to diverge. The bull's eye marks the centre.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="text/figs/convDiv.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<p>Can we say more about the convergence and/or divergence of the series for other values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span> Yes!</p>
<p>Let us think about the radius of convergence, <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> of the series. We know that it must exist and the information we have been given allows us to bound <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Recall that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>the series converges at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> provided that <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \lt R\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p>the series diverges at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \gt R\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">We have been told that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>the series converges when <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{,}\)</span> which tells us that</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> cannot obey <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \gt R\)</span> so</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> must obey <span class="process-math">\(|x-3|\le R\text{,}\)</span> i.e. <span class="process-math">\(|4-3|\le R\text{,}\)</span> i.e. <span class="process-math">\(R\ge 1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the series diverges when <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> so we also know that</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> cannot obey <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \lt R\)</span> so</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> must obey <span class="process-math">\(|x-3|\ge R\text{,}\)</span> i.e. <span class="process-math">\(|1-3|\ge R\text{,}\)</span> i.e. <span class="process-math">\(R\le 2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">We still don't know <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> exactly. But we do know that <span class="process-math">\(1\le R\le 2\text{.}\)</span> Consequently,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>since <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is the smallest that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> could be, the series certainly converges at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> i.e. if <span class="process-math">\(2 \lt x \lt 4\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p>since <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is the largest that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> could be, the series certainly diverges at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(|x-3| \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> i.e. if <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 5\)</span> or if <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The following figure provides a resume of all of this convergence data â€” there is convergence at green <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s and divergence at red <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:17%;margin-right:17%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="text/figs/convDivB.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<p>Notice that from the data given we cannot say anything about the convergence or divergence of the series on the intervals <span class="process-math">\((1,2]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((4,5]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>One lesson that we can derive from this example is that,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>if a series has centre <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and converges at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>then it also converges at all points between <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> as well as at all points of distance strictly less than <span class="process-math">\(|a-c|\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> on the other side of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
