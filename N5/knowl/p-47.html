<p>To find the limit, or show that it does not exist, we are going to have to exhibit a cancellation between the numerator and the denominator. To develop a strategy for evaluating this limit, let's do a “little scratch work”, starting by taking a closer look at the denominator. By Example<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "eg_bigohlog" missing or not unique]</code>,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
\log(1+x) = x+O(x^2)
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This tells us that <span class="process-math">\(\log(1+x)\)</span> looks a lot like <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for very small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> So the denominator <span class="process-math">\([x+O(x^2)]^4\)</span> looks a lot like <span class="process-math">\(x^4\)</span> for very small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Now, what about the numerator?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If the numerator looks like some constant times <span class="process-math">\(x^p\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(p \gt 4\text{,}\)</span> for very small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then the ratio will look like the constant times  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x^p}{x^4}=x^{p-4}\)</span> and, as <span class="process-math">\(p-4 \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> will tend to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>  tends to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>If the numerator looks like some constant times <span class="process-math">\(x^p\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(p \lt 4\text{,}\)</span> for very small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then the ratio will look like the constant times  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x^p}{x^4}=x^{p-4}\)</span> and will, as <span class="process-math">\(p-4 \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> tend to infinity, and in particular diverge, as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> tends to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>If the numerator looks like  <span class="process-math">\(Cx^4\text{,}\)</span> for very small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then the ratio will look like <span class="process-math">\(\frac{Cx^4}{x^4}=C\)</span> and will tend to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> as  <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> tends to zero.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The moral of the above “scratch work” is that we need to know the behaviour of the numerator, for small <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> up to order <span class="process-math">\(x^4\text{.}\)</span> Any contributions of order <span class="process-math">\(x^p\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(p \gt 4\)</span> may be put into error terms <span class="process-math">\(O(|x|^p)\text{.}\)</span></p>
