<p>As a result,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>if <span class="process-math">\(P(0)=0\text{,}\)</span> the graph starts out horizontally. In other words, as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> starts to increase, <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> remains at zero, so the slope of the graph remains at zero. The population size remains zero for all time. As a check, observe that  the function <span class="process-math">\(P(t)=0\)</span> obeys <span class="process-math">\(\diff{P}{t}(t)=\big(6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\)</span>  for all <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(P(0)=2000\text{,}\)</span> the graph again starts out  horizontally. So <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> remains at <span class="process-math">\(2000\)</span> and the slope remains at zero.  The population size remains 2000 for all time. Again, the function  <span class="process-math">\(P(t)=2000\)</span> obeys <span class="process-math">\(\diff{P}{t}(t)=\big(6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(P(0)=1000\text{,}\)</span> the graph starts out with positive slope. So <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> increases with <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> increases towards 2000, the slope <span class="process-math">\((6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\text{,}\)</span> while remaining positive, gets closer and closer to zero. As the graph approaches height 2000, it becomes more and more  horizontal. The graph cannot actually cross from below 2000 to above 2000, because to do so it would have to have strictly positive slope for  some value of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> above 2000, which is not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(P(0)=3000\text{,}\)</span> the graph starts out with negative slope. So <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> decreases with <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\)</span> decreases towards 2000, the slope <span class="process-math">\((6000-3P(t)\big)P(t)\text{,}\)</span> while remaining negative, gets closer and closer to zero. As the graph approaches height 2000, it becomes more and more  horizontal. The graph cannot actually cross from above 2000 to below 2000, because to do so it would have to have negative slope for some value of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> below 2000, which is not allowed.</p></li>
