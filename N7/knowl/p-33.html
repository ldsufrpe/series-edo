</div></article> This mathematical model of temperature change works well when  studying a small object in a large, fixed temperature, environment.  For example, a hot cup of coffee in a large room <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Nota de rodapé 1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>. Let's start by thinking a little about the sign of the constant of proportionality. At any time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> there are three possibilities.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(T(t) \gt A\text{,}\)</span> that is, if the body is warmer than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the body into its surroundings and so we would expect the body to cool off so that  <span class="process-math">\(\diff{T}{t}(t) \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> For this  expectation to be consistent with (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Fato 1.13: Newton's law of cooling">Fato 1.13</a>), we need <span class="process-math">\(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(T(t) \lt A\text{,}\)</span> that is the body is cooler than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the surroundings into the body and so we would expect the body to warm up so that  <span class="process-math">\(\diff{T}{t}(t) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> For this  expectation to be consistent with (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Fato 1.13: Newton's law of cooling">Fato 1.13</a>), we again need <span class="process-math">\(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Finally if <span class="process-math">\(T(t)=A\text{,}\)</span> that is the body and its environment have the same temperature, we would not expect any heat to flow between the two and so we would expect that <span class="process-math">\(\diff{T}{t}(t)=0\text{.}\)</span> This does not impose any condition on <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">In conclusion, we would expect <span class="process-math">\(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> Of course, we could have chosen to call the constant of proportionality <span class="process-math">\(-k\text{,}\)</span> rather than <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> Then the differential equation would be  <span class="process-math">\(\diff{T}{t} = -k\big(T-A\big)\)</span> and we would expect <span class="process-math">\(k \gt 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
