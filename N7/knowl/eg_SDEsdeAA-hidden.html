<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
e^y\,\dee{y} = x\,\dee{x}

<p class="continuation">Then we integrate both sides</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^y\dee{y} = \int x\dee{x} \iff e^y = \frac{x^2}{2}+C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> on the right hand side contains both the arbitrary constant  for the indefinite integral <span class="process-math">\(\int e^y\dee{y}\)</span> and the arbitrary constant for  the indefinite integral  <span class="process-math">\(\int x\dee{x}\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span>  which is really a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p>

\begin{equation*}
y(x) = \log\Big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\Big)

<p class="continuation">Recall that we are using <span class="process-math">\(\log\)</span> to refer to the natural (base <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span>) logarithm.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is an arbitrary constant. It can take any value. It cannot be determined by the differential equation itself. In applications <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is usually determined by a requirement that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> take some prescribed value (determined by the  application) when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is some prescribed value. For example, suppose that we wish to find a function <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\)</span> that obeys both</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{y}{x} = xe^{-y}\qquad\text{and}\qquad y(0)=1

</div>
<p class="continuation">We know that, to have <span class="process-math">\(\diff{y}{x} = xe^{-y}\)</span> satisfied, we must have  <span class="process-math">\(y(x) = \log\big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\big)\text{,}\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> To also have <span class="process-math">\(y(0)=1\text{,}\)</span> we must have</p>

1=y(0)=\log\Big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\Big)\bigg|_{x=0}=\log C \iff \log C =1 \iff C=e
