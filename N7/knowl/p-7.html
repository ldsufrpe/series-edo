<p>Observe that the solution equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_SDEbasicSlnRig.html" title="Equação 1.1">(1.1)</a> contains an arbitrary constant, <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The value of this arbitrary constant <em class="emphasis">can not</em> be determined by the differential equation. You need additional data to determine it. Often this data consists of the value of the unknown function for one value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> That is, often the problem you have to solve is of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_SDEbasicSlnRig.html">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{y}{x}(x) = f(x)\ g\big(y(x)\big)\qquad y(x_0)=y_0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(y)\)</span> are given functions and <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_0\)</span> are given numbers. This type of problem is called an “initial value problem”. It is solved by first using the method above to find the general solution to the differential equation, including the arbitrary constant <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> and then using the “initial condition” <span class="process-math">\(y(x_0)=y_0\)</span> to determine the value of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> We'll see examples of this shortly.</p>
